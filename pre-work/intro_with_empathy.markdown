### Turing Culture: Developing Empathetic Programmers

_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### Why Empathy?
* Interpersonal skills (including empathy) have a direct, significant impact on your professional success.
* Empathy is a foundational interpersonal skill. Other skills, such as collaboration, communication, compromise all hinge on your ability to demonstrate empathy.
* Interpersonal skills, including empathy, can be developed and improved.
* Turing's mission (cited above) demands that we support students development of technical _and_ interpersonal skills. 

### Pre-Work Preparation

Read _two_ of the following articles/videos (we recommend all of them!) and reflect on these questions: why are we talking about empathy at a software development school? how can you develop the "skill" of empathy? and why should you care?

#### Reflect
**What role does empathy play in your life and how has it helped you?**  
Every year on my birthday, I try to do some self-reflection. I think about how I'm shaping the world and other people, and this naturally leads to thinking about how they view the world. Check-ins, like this gear up, help to combat empathy fatigue, which I think a lot of people are struggling with right now. It's hard to explain why you should care about other people, especially when it doesn't always "help us,” but it's still important even if it doesn't. Personally, empathy has helped me - I've built strong and lasting relationships, and I've done a lot of things that I can reflect on with pride.

**How does empathy help you build better software?**  
Building better software involves building systems from the user’s point-of-view. Something Daniel Goman said in his TED Talk also got me thinking, "ultimately, everybody will know everything. And the question is: will it make a difference?" I think think that if our software can build stronger connections between people and places, it will make a difference. The media we consume can have a subtle but profound effect on us and it's important to be empathetic and make it easy for others to do the same when they're interacting with our products.  

**Why is empathy important for working on a team?**  
The Surprising (and Non-Technical) Skill You Need to Succeed in Tech demonstrated some of the essential skills, including working on self-awareness, learning how to give and receive feedback, and practice active listening. Self- awareness is important because once you learn to identify negative emotions and understand what triggers them, you can learn to express yourself without negatively impacting others. I have a hard time giving and receiving feedback but, with empathy, I've learned to understand when I've hurt someone and how to apologize. I think it's very, very important to think about how they're going to feel when you give feedback- your intentions might be good, but untactful feedback can hurt a relationship. Active listening means paying full attention to the other person, so put down what you’re working doing.

**Describe a situation in which your ability to empathize with a colleague or teammate was helpful.**   
It's important to build a trusting relationship so that when mistakes are made, your employees will tell you about them and you can work together to fix them. I can think of a couple of instances when my employees have made glaring mistakes and they feel ashamed. In that situation, it's not always helpful to give feedback- they know what they've done and they simply need help remedying the situation. Maybe we can prevent it from happening again in the future, but sometimes, people just make mistakes. When you help others fix their mistakes, it builds a stronger team!  

**When do you find it most difficult to be empathetic in professional settings? How can you improve your skills when faced with these scenarios?**  
I don't take negative feedback well - that's one of the reasons I wasn't successful in the service industry! You can't please everyone and there are a lot of factors outside of our control. Recognizing that can give you peace of mind, but when there are things we have the power to change, it's important to do so. Reflecting on my very limited time in the service industry, I could've made a lot of little changes that would've improved both my and the customer's experience. Some things that were important to customers seemed trivial to me and if I would've considered things from their perspective, it could've made a lot of improvements. I think that applies well to software development because it's so detail-oriented!
